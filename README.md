# Basic Weather App

This weather application allows you to search for weather conditions in any city around the world. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data and 6-day forecasts. I created this website so that people learning how to deploy a website can freely use it and have a fun, interactive experience. Enjoy learning!

You can view the website using this link: [Basic Weather App](https://pawanreddipalli.github.io/Basic-Weather-App/)

*Note*: The currently running version of the website is v2, not the main branch.

### Features

* **Search by City:** Enter a city name to see current weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description) and a 6-day forecast.
* **Temperature Units:** Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
* **Search History:** Easily access previously searched cities from the search history for quick reference.
* **Geolocation Support (Optional):** (If your browser allows) Use your current location to retrieve the weather data.

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**
    
    git clone [https://github.com/pawanreddipalli/Basic-Weather-App](https://github.com/pawanreddipalli/Basic-Weather-App)
    
**2. Replace the API key:**

Crucially, you must obtain your own OpenWeatherMap API key to use this application. Sign up for a free API key at https://openweathermap.org/api.

Once you have your API key, open the index.html file and replace the placeholder value ('') for apiKey with your own API key.

## Additional features:

* Use the dropdown menu to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
* Click on a city in the search history to revisit its weather information.
* Click the "Use My Location" button (if allow by the user) to get weather data based on your current location (might require browser permissions).
